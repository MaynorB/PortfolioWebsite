Maynor is a computer scientist who does not like sitting down all day coding, he prefers making a sonic sensor detect if he is in front of it or not. When not sobbing in the corner because of his classes he chose, he enjoys gaming, skating around and failing the tricks, gymming, listening to music, buying more Jordans, looking at cars and laying down in the randomest places you can think of.
